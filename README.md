## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was trivial and I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be in a lower difficulty level. I haven't learned anything new but I did apply a grid layout similar to (but much simpler than) the Bento box challenge.
